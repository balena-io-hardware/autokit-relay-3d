> **Note:** If the relay board feels flimsy inside the case you may use M2.5x6mm screws to hold it in place

> **Note:** Ensure that the correct colours are used for line (brown), earth (yellow/green) and neutral (blue) following EU/UK IEC convention

> **Note:** Ensure that the L/N/E terminals of the C13/14 terminals are connected to the corresponding terminal on the other entry module, via the relay (e.g L connected to L etc)
