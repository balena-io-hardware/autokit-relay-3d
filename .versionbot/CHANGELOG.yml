    - subject: case design update
- commits:
    - body: >-
        - Reduced the overall size of the case

        - Reduced the size of the C13/C14 holes - the screw can self thread

        - Made an opening under the PCB for the solder pins to not collide with the case

        - The bottom part is designed to push the relay against the top part and lock it in place with no screws

        - Added 4 pegs at the bottom for alignment with the top

        - Changed the top and bottom corner radiuses so it prints without support reliably
